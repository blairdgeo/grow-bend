Urban Layers
=======

Layers of NYC is an interactive map created by Morphocode that explores the structure of Manhattan's urban fabric.

The map lets you navigate through historical fragments of the city that have been preserved and are now embedded in Manhattan's densely built environment. The rigid archipelago of building blocks has been mapped as a succession of structural episodes starting from 1765.

Use the timeline sliders to identify some of Manhattan's oldest buildings; discover how the beginning of the 20th century marked the island skyline or to define the distribution of building activity over the last decades.
